    <h1><u>Data Strcuture</u></h1>
    <p>A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.<br/>
         A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.<br/>There are different basic and advanced types of 
         data structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must have good knowledge about data structures.</p>
    <h2>Classification of Data Structure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b><u>Linear Data Structure</b></u>: Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
            <br/>Example: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc
            <ol>
                <br/>
                <li><b>Static Data Structure</b>: Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure.
                    <br/>Example: array.
                    <ol>
                        <br/>
                        <li><b>Array:</b>
                            Array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.<br/> Elements are allocated contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access. Each element has a unique index number.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <br/>
                <li><b>Dynamic Data Structure</b>: In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed.<br/> It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.
                    <br/>Example: Queue, Stack, etc. 
                    <ol>
                        <br/>
                        <li><b>Queue:</b>
                            Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.<br/> Queues play an important role in managing tasks or data in order, scheduling and message handling systems.</li>
                            <br/>
                        <li><b>Stack:</b>
                            Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.<br/> Stacks play an important role in managing function calls, memory, and are widely used in algorithms, web development, and systems like compilers and browsers.</li>
                            <br/>
                        <li><b>Linked List:</b>
                            Linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers.<br/> Unlike arrays, nodes of linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations and can only be accessed sequentially, starting from the head of list.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li><br/>
        <li><b><u>Non-Linear Data Structure</b></u>: Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.<br/> In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 
            <br/>Examples: Trees and Graphs.
            <ol>
                <br/>
                <li><b>Tree:</b>
                    Tree is a non-linear, hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a top node called the root and nodes having child nodes.<br/> It is widely used in file systems, databases, decision-making algorithms, etc.</li>
                    <br/>
                <li><b>Graph:</b>
                    Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges(or links)that connect a pair of nodes.<br/> Graphs are widely used to represent relationships between entities.</li>
